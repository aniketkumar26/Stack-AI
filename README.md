DALL·E is a 12-billion parameter version of GPT-3 trained to generate images from text descriptions, using a dataset of text–image pairs. We’ve found that it has a diverse set of capabilities, including creating anthropomorphized versions of animals and objects, combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways, rendering text, and applying transformations to existing images.

See also: DALL·E 2, which generates more realistic and accurate images with 4x greater resolution.
# There are many theories about how AI painting will change how we look at art. Here are a few things to keep in mind about this new genre.

Anyone can create digital images now: It can be challenging to create a digital image due to a lack of creativity or artistic skills. With AI, anyone can simply insert text into the tool and wait for the design to be drafted.

You’re going to question what you consider art: Even though art is subjective, these new AI-generated images will challenge what we think of as art. You can also create new types of art, so there could be new styles of art that come out of this.

AI may simplify certain complex tasks: Instead of trying to explain what you want to a graphic designer, you can simply use text and get multiple images created. While this tool is still in its infancy, there’s no telling what changes will come next.

The lines of ownership are blurred: With the ability to create images from simple text prompts, it will be difficult to determine ownership of creative artwork in the future.
# To be able to work on the project, you will need to clone it to your computer.

1.You can clone your fork with the command line, GitHub CLI, or GitHub Desktop.

2.On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Stack-Ai repository.
Copy the URL for the repository.

To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", click .
To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click .
To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click .


Above the list of files, click  Code.
Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:

$ git clone https://github.com/aniketkumar26/Stack-Ai.
Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

$ git clone https://github.com/aniketkumar26/Stack-Ai.

> Before making changes to the project, you should create a new branch and check it out. By keeping changes in their own branch, you follow GitHub Flow and ensure that it will be easier to contribute to the same project again in the future. For more information, see "GitHub flow."

git branch BRANCH-NAME
git checkout BRANCH-NAME 
When you stage and commit files, you essentially tell Git, "Okay, take a snapshot of my changes!" You can continue to make more changes, and take more commit snapshots.

Right now, your changes only exist locally. When you're ready to push your changes up to GitHub, push your changes to the remote.

git push
